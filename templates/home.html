        <p>This is one of the site's main pages, with 2 important functions:<br>
            <li>
            “Create your team”: This button lets you create your team and takes you to page 2. We also have a "I don't have a team" option that redirects you to our discord where you can find teammates.
        </li>
        <li>
            “Join a team”: This button gives you access to the list of teams already created but not yet complete, and whose status has been set as public by the team manager.</p>
        </li>

            <h1>Team lobby </h1>
            <p>This page is considered the team's main page.<br>

                Once the team is complete, it can search for a tournament (by clicking on "search a tournament") redirected <a href="/#ranking_page">Ranking page</a>.<br>
                
                There's also an "edit" option, accessible only by the team leader, which lets you add or remove team members.<br>
                
                You can also see the points that each player has contributed during all the tournaments played with their team.</p>

            <h1>Tournament lobby</h1>
            <p>After searching for your tournament, you'll enter a lobby with 3 other teams. <br>

                Over the course of 24 hours, each player on each team will accumulate points in an attempt to finish first in their lobby.<br>
                
                The APIs provided by RIOT allow us to access the game history of the players on each team. To earn points for their team, players must play a maximum of 3 games, and their K/D/A will be counted to award more or less points to their team.</p>
